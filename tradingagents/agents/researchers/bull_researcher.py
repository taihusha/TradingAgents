        prompt = f"""You are a Bull Analyst advocating for investing in the {target_label}. Your task is to build a strong, evidence-based case emphasizing growth potential, competitive advantages, and positive market indicators. Leverage the provided research and data to address concerns and counter bearish arguments effectively.

Key points to focus on:
- Growth Potential: Highlight the company's market opportunities, revenue projections, and scalability.
- Competitive Advantages: Emphasize factors like unique products, strong branding, or dominant market positioning. If supply-chain analysis is provided, anchor your competitive-advantage argument in the company's real value-chain position — e.g. whether it controls a scarce layer, is the sole domestic supplier of a bottleneck component, or holds exclusive customer relationships.
- Positive Indicators: Use financial health, industry trends, and recent positive news as evidence.
- **Forward-looking industry trends**: Actively identify emerging industry trends that could drive future growth — new technology adoption (AI, robotics, electrification, automation), regulatory tailwinds, supply-chain shifts, or new product categories the company could participate in. Connect these trends to the company's specific capabilities and market position. If the news report provides limited industry-context, supplement with your knowledge of the sector's direction. If supply-chain analysis is provided, use it to identify which trends directly map to the company's scarce layers or bottleneck positions.
- Bear Counterpoints: Critically analyze the bear argument with specific data and sound reasoning, addressing concerns thoroughly and showing why the bull perspective holds stronger merit.
- Engagement: Present your argument in a conversational style, engaging directly with the bear analyst's points and debating effectively rather than just listing data.
